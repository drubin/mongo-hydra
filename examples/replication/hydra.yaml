# Define a replica set
# to support multiple replica sets use multiple config files
replicaSet:
  # Replica set name
  replicaSetName: mongo-rs
  # The servers that should be part of this replica set
  # host: The host mongo internally uses to name and connect to these
  # uri: the  URI that  hydra uses  to connect and configure (can be a mapping/port-forwarding/public URI)
  servers:
  - host: mongo-rs-0:27000
    uri: mongodb://localhost:27000
  - host: mongo-rs-1:27001
    uri: mongodb://localhost:27001
  - host: mongo-rs-2:27002
    uri: mongodb://localhost:27002
